    """CMMCorePlus for the Moench (Nikon Ti): confirm stage moves and cube changes.

    On the Nikon Ti the TIXYDrive/TIZDrive ``Busy()`` flag stays true for
    several seconds after every move, because Micro-Manager is never told the
    move finished, and the Mosaic3 DMD's ``Busy()`` is stuck the same way. So
    ``waitForDevice``/``waitForSystem`` wait ~5 s per move for nothing. The
    move itself finishes in under a second and the stage's reported position is
    always current, so this core waits for the XY and focus stages by reading
    their position until it reaches the commanded target, and does not wait on
    :attr:`SKIP_BUSY_DEVICES` at all.

    ``set(Relative)(XY/Z)Position`` stores the commanded target and marks that
    stage as "moving". ``waitForDevice``/``waitForSystem`` then wait for a
    moving stage by reading its position, and clear the mark once it arrives. A
    stage that was not commanded to move returns at once, because it is not
    moving and its stuck ``Busy()`` is never read. Any other device uses the
    normal wait.

    The same adapter silently skips a filter-cube (turret) change when its
    cached position already equals the target, so a genuinely needed change can
    be dropped and a frame acquired through the wrong cube. ``setConfig`` /
    ``setStateLabel`` / ``setState`` read the turret back after the change and,
    on a mismatch, force a real move by going to a neighbour position and back;
    the success path is a single read with no extra rotation, and the forced
    move fires only on a detected miss (capped at
    :attr:`FILTER_VERIFY_MAX_CORRECTIONS`).

    Sharing this core with napari-micromanager gives its interactive moves and
    channel changes the same handling, and the base engine's plain
    ``waitForSystem()`` / ``setConfig()`` calls keep :class:`MoenchMDAEngine`
    correct. napari-micromanager adopts the first ``CMMCorePlus`` ever
    constructed as its singleton, so it picks up this core automatically as
    long as :class:`Moench` is created before any napari-micromanager widget
    constructs a core of its own.

        Why: the closed NikonTI adapter decides whether to move the turret by
        comparing the request against an internal, callback-fed position cache,
        and silently skips the move when they are equal ("Already at position;
        not moving", no exception, no error log). A missed position callback
        desyncs that cache, so a needed cube change can be dropped and the frame
        acquired through the wrong cube. Unlike XY/Z, the turret has no
        independent re-read or safety timeout in the adapter, so one is added
        here.

        Strategy (cheap by default; an extra rotation only on a miss):
          1. read the turret back; if it equals the target, return (the common
             case, one fast read, no extra movement);
          2. on mismatch, force a real move by first going to a neighbour
             position (which breaks the ``target == cache`` equality the adapter
             uses to suppress the move) and then to the target, re-checking each
             time, up to :attr:`FILTER_VERIFY_MAX_CORRECTIONS`;
          3. if it still will not land, log loudly (and, when
             :attr:`FILTER_VERIFY_RAISE_ON_FAILURE`, raise) so a long run
             surfaces the failure instead of silently collecting wrong-cube data.

        The read-back goes through the same cache the adapter compares against,
        so it cannot catch the rarer case where the cache wrongly equals the
        target. Forcing the move unconditionally would catch that case too,
        but it doubles turret wear on every change, which this rig's ~15 s
        imaging cadence cannot afford.
